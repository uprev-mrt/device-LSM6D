<br/>
>Partnumber: LSM6DS3TR

Device driver for LSM6D iNEMO inertial module (Accelerometer and Gyroscope).

LSM6DS3 is a system-in-package featuring a 3D digital accelerometer and a 3D gyroscope performing at 1.25 mA (up to 1.6 kHz ODR) in high-performance mode and enabling always-on low-power features for an optimal motion experience for the consumer. The LSM6DS3 supports main OS requirements, offering real, virtual, and batch sensors with 8 kbyte for dramatic data batching. 

## Features:

* Power consumption: 0.9 mA in combo normal mode and 1.25 mA in combo * high-performance mode up to 1.6 kHz
* "Always on" experience with low power consumption for both accelerometer and * gyroscope
* Smart FIFO (first-in-first-out) memory up to 8 kbyte based on features set
* Compliant with Android K and L
* Hard, soft ironing for external magnetic sensor corrections
* +2/+4/+8/+16 g full scale
* +125/+245/+500/+1000/+2000 dps full scale
* Analog supply voltage: 1.71 V to 3.6 V
* Independent IOs supply (1.62 V)
* Compact footprint, 2.5 mm x 3 mm x 0.83 mm
* SPI/I2C serial interface with main processor data synchronization feature
* Embedded temperature sensor
* ECOPACKÂ®, RoHS- and "green" compliant

## Applications

* Pedometers, step-detectors and step counters
* Significant motion and tilt functions
* Indoor navigation
* Tap and double-tap detection
* IoT (Internet of Things) and connected devices
* Intelligent power saving for handheld devices
* Vibration monitoring and compensation
* Free-fall detection
* 6D orientation detection
